# Redux Todos 

Stolen directly from the [redux repo](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/9c9a4d2a1c62c9dbddcbb05488f8bd77d24c81de/examples/todos)

This repo already has redux - you'll use it as a baseline, and integrate all of the nice `redux toolkit` features into it.

## Setup 

* Clone this repo
* `cd` to cloned directory
* `npm install`
* `npm start` to start the server
